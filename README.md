 3.3 Compare and contrast concepts and strategies to protect data
 
Trade Secret: Information that is kept secret by a company to maintain a competitive edge (e.g., a unique recipe or manufacturing process).
Intellectual Property: Creations of the mind (e.g., inventions, designs, trademarks, copyrights) that are protected by law.
Legal Information: Data related to legal matters, such as contracts, court records, or compliance documents.
Financial Information: Data related to monetary transactions, bank accounts, credit card details, and financial statements.
Human- and Non-Human Readable:
Human-readable: Data that can be easily understood by people (e.g., text, numbers).
Non-human readable: Data that is in a format not easily understood by people without a machine to decode it (e.g., encrypted data).
Data Classifications
Sensitive: Data that requires protection due to its potential harm if exposed (e.g., medical records, personal identifiers).
Confidential: Data that is private and should only be accessed by authorized individuals (e.g., company secrets).
Public: Data that can be freely accessed and shared with anyone (e.g., public records, open-source content).
Restricted: Data that has limited access, usually for a specific purpose or group of people (e.g., restricted access research data).
Private: Personal data that belongs to individuals and is protected from unauthorized access (e.g., personal emails, personal contact information).
Critical: Data essential for the operation of an organization or system (e.g., nuclear power plant controls, banking infrastructure).
General Data Considerations
Data States:

Data at Rest: Data that is stored and not actively being used or transferred (e.g., data stored on a hard drive or cloud storage).
Data in Transit: Data that is actively being transferred across networks (e.g., sending emails or streaming video).
Data in Use: Data that is being actively processed, modified, or interacted with by software or systems (e.g., open files on your computer).
Data Sovereignty: The concept that data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country in which it is stored or processed.

Geolocation: The identification of the physical location of data based on geographical coordinates, usually related to IP addresses or GPS.

Methods to Secure Data
Geographic Restrictions: Limiting access to data based on the location of the user or system (e.g., only allowing access to a service from specific countries).
Encryption: The process of converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. Only authorized users with the decryption key can read the data.
Hashing: A one-way process that converts data into a fixed-size string of characters, which cannot be easily reversed to the original data. Often used for verifying data integrity.
Masking: Replacing sensitive data with anonymized or fictitious data (e.g., showing only the last four digits of a credit card number).
Tokenization: Replacing sensitive data with a non-sensitive placeholder, called a token, that can be mapped back to the original data in a secure environment.
Obfuscation: Making data intentionally unclear or harder to understand, usually by altering its format, to protect it from unauthorized access or use.
Segmentation: Dividing data into smaller, isolated parts to reduce risk if one part is compromised (e.g., isolating sensitive data from less sensitive data).
Permission Restrictions: Controlling who can access and modify data based on roles and permissions (e.g., only certain employees can access HR records).
